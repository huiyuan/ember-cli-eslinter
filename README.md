# Ember-cli-eslinter [DEPRECATED]

This fork is **DEPRECATED**! Please use [ember-cli-eslint](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-eslint) instead. [broccoli-lint-eslint](https://github.com/jonathanKingston/broccoli-lint-eslint) now provides test generator functions enough information to differentiate between errors and warnings. Since that was the goal of broccoli-eslinter, and the goal of ember-cli-eslinter was to package broccoli-eslinter for integration with ember-cli, ember-cli-eslinter is no longer necessary.
